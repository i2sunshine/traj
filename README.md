Brief intro: 
<p>
Estimated Glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is a biomarker of human kidney function. Lower value, poorer kidney function. Generally, a eGFR below 60 may mean kidney disease. A eGFR of 15 or lower may mean kidney failure.
Given a patient, his eGFR measurements can be extracted from all his electronic health records (EHRs) or/and collected from cohort studies.

Goal of this project: 
<p>
For each patient, to apply low-rank thin-plate spline regression under Bayesian framework to modelling his kidney function trajectory based on his longitudinal eGFR measurements.
